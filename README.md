# Trivago Winery

### `WHAT HAS BEEN DONE`

I have created an mvp of a e-comerce where customers can choose a wine(s) an visulizate it on a cart.

I have use react with redux for the frontend and node.js, express, mongodb for the backend.

There are two sections, one with the daily waines and another one with the rest. Customers just can make an order if the wine is in the day selection.


### `HOW TO`

#### `npm start - client folder`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

####`npm start - server folder`

Server will be opened on PORT: 5000

## `Mlab.com MongoDB Hosting`

Data base has been hosted on mlab, so everything is already configurated.


## `npm test`

I have make two types of tests, react jest for the front and Mocha & Chai for the back.

### `DEPENDENCES`

## `Frontend dependences installed`

Redux --> Global storage. I think is the best way to manage the state.
Moment.js --> Manipulate times.


### `Backend dependences installed`

### `Dependences Installed`

rss-parser --> A small library for turning RSS XML feeds into JavaScript objects.
node-schedule -->  Cron-like and not-cron-like job scheduler for Node.js
